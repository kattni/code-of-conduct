# kattni:decoded GitHub Community Guidelines
This community is built around sharing knowledge and information, and learning new things from a diverse group of people. It takes all of us to create a space folks want to be a part of. The following guidelines are meant to help make that happen.

* Be respectful, considerate, and kind to others. 
* Be open to learning new things and sharing ideas.
* No politics, religion, hate speech, promoting violence, or any other topics deemed inappropriate.
* Follow the [GitHub Community Code of Conduct](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-code-of-conduct).
* Admins and moderators have final say in all matters pertaining to the community.

Community members asked to stop or change a behavior are expected to comply immediately.
